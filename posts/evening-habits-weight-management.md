Your evening routine sets the tone for your hunger, energy and mood the next day. Small improvements can create noticeable changes in weight management over time.

Here are science-informed habits that support a healthier metabolism and more predictable appetite.

## 1. Reduce bright screen exposure at night

Blue light delays melatonin production, disrupting sleep quality. Poor sleep is strongly associated with:

- increased cravings  

- lower energy  

- more belly fat  

Try:

- dimming screens  

- using night mode  

- avoiding doom-scrolling  

---

## 2. Avoid heavy late-night meals

Eating large meals right before bed may impair digestion and disrupt sleep.

Options instead:

- herbal tea  

- yogurt  

- a light protein snack  

---

## 3. Choose calming activities

Stress increases cortisol, which can influence appetite and fat storage.

Try:

- a warm shower  

- light stretching  

- breathing exercises  

- reading  

---

## 4. Prepare your next morning

Making mornings smoother reduces decision fatigue.

Examples:

- prepare breakfast ahead  

- set clothes aside  

- plan your workout  

---

## 5. Keep a consistent sleep window

Most adults benefit from **7–9 hours** of sleep.

Better sleep = better appetite regulation.

## What about supplements?

Some people take natural supplements in the evening to support appetite, blood sugar or metabolic health. This is optional — not essential.
