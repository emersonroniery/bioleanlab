Protein is one of the most important nutrients for sustainable fat loss. Not because it magically burns fat, but because it supports muscle maintenance, appetite control and daily energy levels.

This beginner-friendly guide explains how protein helps with fat loss and how to structure your meals realistically.

---

## Why protein matters for fat loss

### 1. Helps maintain muscle mass  

When losing weight, preserving muscle is essential. Muscle burns more calories than fat — even at rest.

### 2. Increases satiety  

Protein reduces hunger hormones and keeps you full for longer.

### 3. Higher thermic effect  

Your body burns more calories digesting protein compared to carbs or fats.

### 4. Supports stable energy levels  

Protein evenly distributes energy throughout the day.

## How much protein do you need?

A common science-informed guideline is:

- **0.7 to 1 gram per pound of goal body weight**  

- or **1.6 to 2.2 grams per kg**

Example:

If your goal weight is 70 kg, aim for **110–150 grams per day**.

## Best high-protein foods

### Animal-based:

- chicken, turkey  

- fish and seafood  

- eggs  

- low-fat dairy (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese)  

### Plant-based:

- lentils  

- tofu and tempeh  

- beans  

- quinoa

## Simple high-protein meal ideas

- Greek yogurt + berries  

- Chicken + vegetables + rice  

- Omelet with spinach  

- Tuna + sweet potato  

- Tofu stir fry

## How to distribute protein throughout the day

Aim for **20–40 grams per meal**.

Spacing protein across meals helps with:

- muscle protein synthesis  

- appetite control  

- stable blood sugar

## Should you use supplements?

Protein powders can help if you struggle to reach daily targets, but whole foods should come first.

Some people also use metabolism or appetite-support supplements. If considering one, start by checking formulas with natural, evidence-inspired ingredients.
