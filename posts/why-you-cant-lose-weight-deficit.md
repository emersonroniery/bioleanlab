Many people say: "I'm eating less, but the scale isn't moving."  
If this is happening to you, you're not alone — and it does NOT mean fat loss is impossible.

Science identifies several reasons why weight loss may stall even during a calorie deficit.

---

## 1. Inaccurate calorie tracking

Studies show that people often underestimate calorie intake by **20–50%** — without realizing it.

Common hidden calories:

- oils  

- sauces  

- beverages  

- nuts  

- extra bites and snacks  

---

## 2. Water retention masking fat loss

High sodium, stress, inflammation and menstrual phases can all cause significant water retention.

You might be losing fat, but the **scale doesn't show it yet**.

---

## 3. Reduced movement during dieting

When calories drop:

- NEAT (non-exercise activity) decreases  

- spontaneous movement decreases  

These unconscious reductions can slow fat loss.

Walking more helps counteract this.

---

## 4. Metabolic adaptation

The body becomes more efficient during dieting. This adaptation is small but real.

It does not stop fat loss, but it slows the rate slightly.

## 5. Digestive fluctuations

Constipation or irregular digestion can hide actual progress temporarily.

## Should you use supplements?

Supplements won't fix a calorie deficit, but some formulas may help with appetite control or metabolic support.

## Bottom line

A stalled scale does not mean a stalled body.  
Fat loss continues as long as:

- intake is consistent  

- movement stays high  

- sleep is adequate  

- stress is managed  

The scale is just one tool — not the whole story.
